    "#Benchmarking Performance and Scaling of Python Clustering Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a host of different clustering algorithms and implementations thereof for Python. The performance and scaling can depend as much on the implementation as the underlying algorithm. Obviously a well written implementation in C or C++ will beat a naive implementation on pure Python, but there is more to it than just that. The internals and data structures used can have a large impact on performance, and can even significanty change asymptotic performance. All of this means that, given some amount of data that you want to cluster your options as to algorithm and implementation maybe significantly constrained. I'm both lazy, and prefer empirical results for this sort of thing, so rather than analyzing the implementations and deriving asymptotic performance numbers for various implementations I'm just going to run everything and see what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with we need to get together all the clustering implementations, along with some plotting libraries so we can see what is going on once we've got data. Obviously this is not an exhaustive collection of clustering implementations, so if I've left off your favourite I apologise, but one has to draw a line somewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementations being test are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html) (which implements several algorithms):\n",
    " * K-Means clustering\n",
    " * DBSCAN clustering\n",
    " * Agglomerative clustering\n",
    " * Spectral clustering\n",
    " * Affinity Propagation\n",
    "* [Scipy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/cluster.html) (which provides basic algorithms):\n",
    " * K-Means clustering\n",
    " * Agglomerative clustering\n",
    "* [Fastcluster](http://danifold.net/fastcluster.html) (which provides very fast agglomerative clustering in C++)\n",
    "* [DeBaCl](https://github.com/CoAxLab/DeBaCl) (Density Based Clustering; similar to a mix of DBSCAN and Agglomerative)\n",
    "* [HDBSCAN](https://github.com/lmcinnes/hdbscan) (A robust hierarchical version of DBSCAN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously a major factor in performance will be the algorithm itself. Some algorithms are simply slower -- often, but not always, because they are doing more work to provide a better clustering."

Since the scaling performance is wildly different over the ten implementations we're going to look at it will be beneficial to have a number of very small dataset sizes, and increasing spacing as we get larger, spanning out to 32000 datapoints to cluster (to begin with). Numpy provides convenient ways to get this done via `arange` and vector multiplication.

    "Now it is just a matter of running all the clustering algorithms via our benchmark function to collect up all the requsite data. This could be prettier, rolled up into functions appropriately, but sometimes brute force is good enough. More importantly (for me) since this can take a significant amount of compute time, I wanted to be able to comment out algorithms that were slow or I was uninterested in easily. Which brings me to a warning for you the reader and potential user of the notebook: this next step is very expensive. We are running ten different clustering algorithms multiple times each on twenty two different dataset sizes -- and some of the clustering algorithms are slow (we are capping out at forty five seconds per run). That means that the next cell can take an hour or more to run. That doesn't mean \"Don't try this at home\" (I actually encourage you to try this out yourself and play with dataset parameters and clustering parameters) but it does mean you should be patient if you're going to!"

    "Now the some differences become clear. The asymptotic complexity starts to kick in with fastcluster failing to keep up. In turn HDBSCAN and DBSCAN, while having sub-$O(n^2)$ complexity, can't achieve $O(n \\log(n))$ at this dataset dimension, and start to curve upward precipitously. Finally it demonstrates again how much of a difference implementation can make: the sklearn implementation of K-Means is far better than the scipy implementation. Since HDBSCAN clustering is a lot better than K-Means (unless you have good reasons to assume that the clusters partition your data and are all drawn from Gaussian distributions) and the scaling is still pretty good I would suggest that unless you have a truly stupendous amount of data you wish to cluster then the HDBSCAN implementation is a good choice."

A little pandas wrangling later and we've produced a table of roughly how large a dataset you can tackle in each time frame with each implementation. I had to leave out the scipy KMeans timings because the noise in timing results caused the model to be unrealistic at larger data sizes. Note how the $O(n\\log n)$ algorithms utterly dominate here. In the meantime, for medium sizes data sets you can still get quite a lot done with HDBSCAN."

    "Performance obviously depends on the algorithm chosen, but can also vary significantly upon the specific implementation (HDBSCAN is far better hierarchical density based clustering than DeBaCl, and sklearn has by far the best K-Means implementation). For anything beyond toy datasets, however, your algorithm options are greatly constrained. In my (obviously biased) opinion [HDBSCAN is the best algorithm for clustering](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/lmcinnes/hdbscan/blob/master/notebooks/Comparing%20Clustering%20Algorithms.ipynb). If you need to cluster data beyond the scope that HDBSCAN can reasonably handle then the only algorithm options on the table are DBSCAN and K-Means; DBSCAN is the slower of the two, especially for very large data, but K-Means clustering can be remarkably poor -- it's a tough choice."
